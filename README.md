MaixPy ported Micropython to K210 (a 64-bit dual-core RISC-V CPU with hardware FPU、FFT、sha256 and convolution accelerator). 
A project that supports MCU routine operations and integrates machine vision and microphone arrays to quickly develop intelligent
applications in the AIOT field that are extremely cost effective and practical.
MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python
standard library and is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments.
K210 created for AIOT(AI+IOT) use, It's powerful performance and low cost are very competitive.
Micropython makes programming on K210 hardware easier, the code is open source and can be found on GitHub)
